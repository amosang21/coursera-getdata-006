==================================================================================
# Assumptions
1. This R script file (**run_analysis.R**) should be placed in the **UCI HAR Dataset** folder. All paths are relative to this folder.
2. All the data source *file names* and *file locations* are as provided by the instructor.
3. My GitHub location for this course's submissions is here: [https://github.com/amosang21/coursera-getdata-006](https://github.com/amosang21/coursera-getdata-006)

# Script Logic Outline
## Overview
This script has been written to follow the instructions as closely as possible. 
The script's structure corresponds to each of the 5 steps, as follows:

## (0) Preliminary steps, such as loading the supporting files
- Here, preliminary steps such as the loading for supporting files into data frames is done. This facilitates easier access.

## (1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

## (2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

## (3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

## (4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

## (5) Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable, for each activity, and each subject
